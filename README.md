The project we are working on is fake news detection
Indeed, internet provides a wealth of information, it has also become a channel for spreading fake news.
Fake news designates false information, most often benefiting from wide spreading, especially on the Internet and social networks. Usually, these stories are created to either influence peopleâ€™s views, cause confusion and can often be a profitable business for online publishers.
For example, in my country, several people have been recently scammed because of a false recruitment rumor. How to fight against this phenomenon? How to help anyone avoid being a victim of fake news? Using the information collected from more than 10,072 respondents, we found that the fake news comes mainly from the Internet and social networks. However, we can't stop using the Internet
the solution that we offer and on which we are working is the implementation of a mobile application based on machine learning that 
will allow anyone to check if information is real or fake. it will just enter the author, source, title and text in the application.
